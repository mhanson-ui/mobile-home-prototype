# MobileHomeProto_V1

A comprehensive prototype demonstrating differentiated rail systems for mobile content discovery, built from analysis of carousel optimization strategies.

## üéØ Project Overview

This prototype implements a **structured, differentiated, and scalable** carousel system that transforms flat endless carousels into intelligent content rails aligned with user intent paradigms.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Principles
- **Differentiated Rail System**: Each rail type has distinct visual and behavioral properties
- **Layered Information Architecture**: Content organized into utility, discovery, and deep catalog bands
- **User Intent Paradigms**: Rails aligned with Continue, Discover, Explore, Decide, and Upsell intents
- **Mobile-First Design**: Touch-optimized interactions and responsive layouts

### Rail Types (16 Total)
1. **Hero Spotlight** - Disney+ style hero carousel with cycling thumbnails
2. **Editorial Hero** - Large editorial content with rich metadata
3. **Continue Watching** - Resume progress with smart deduplication
4. **Live Now** - Real-time content with live indicators
5. **Starting Soon** - Upcoming content with countdown timers
6. **Because You Watched** - AI-powered recommendations
7. **New & Noteworthy** - Fresh content discovery
8. **Trending** - Popular content aggregation
9. **For You Mosaic** - Mixed-size discovery grid
10. **Collections & Packs** - Themed content groupings
11. **Team/League Hubs** - Sports-specific navigation
12. **Highlights & Reels** - Short-form vertical content
13. **Reels Grid** - Multi-column short-form layout
14. **Channel Surf** - Network/channel browsing
15. **Expiring Soon** - Time-sensitive content
16. **People Suggestion** - Creator/person discovery

## üì± Demo Experiences

### Balanced Experience
- General content discovery with mixed genres
- Demonstrates all rail types and interactions
- Access: `demo_balanced/index.html`

### Sports Experience
- Sports-optimized content and features
- Live games, highlights, team hubs
- Access: `demo_sports/index.html`

### Individual Rail Demos
- Focused demonstrations of each rail type
- Purpose and rationale explanations
- Access: `demos/demo_*.html`

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Core Files
- `assets/app.js` - Main application logic and rail rendering
- `assets/styles.css` - Comprehensive styling and responsive design
- `index.html` - Interactive demo launcher

### Data Structure
- JSON-driven content with rich metadata
- Rail priority system for proper ordering
- Content taxonomy with chips and badges

### Key Functions
- `renderRailsFromData()` - Main rendering engine
- `sortRailsByPriority()` - Rail ordering system
- `applyOwnershipDedupe()` - Content deduplication
- `setupHeroCarousel()` - Disney+ style hero carousel

## üé® Design System

### Visual Differentiation
- **Silhouettes**: Hero, large, landscape, thumbnail, mosaic, grid, circle
- **Accent Colors**: Intent-based color coding
- **Motion Policies**: Preview, hover, quick, focus, ticker
- **Card Sizes**: XXL, XL, L, M, S with responsive scaling

### Typography & Layout
- Modern, readable fonts with proper hierarchy
- Gradient overlays with backdrop blur effects
- Consistent spacing and component sizing
- Mobile-optimized touch targets

## üìä Analytics & Debugging

### Console Panel
- Real-time rail visibility tracking
- User interaction logging
- Deduplication statistics
- Performance monitoring

### Instrumentation
- Rail-level impression tracking
- Card click analytics
- Navigation flow monitoring
- Content performance metrics

## üîß Development

### Local Server
```bash
cd MobileHomeProto_V1
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

### Testing
- Open `http://localhost:8000` for main launcher
- Navigate to specific experiences or individual demos
- Use debug panel (top-right button) for development insights

### Customization
- Modify `RailTokens` for new rail types
- Update `RailPriority` for ordering changes
- Add new content in JSON data files
- Extend CSS for visual variations
